            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>AENEAS M<seg rend="sup">c</seg>LEOD</hi> having Purchast the Office of Town-Clerk of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Life, upon payment of a Great Sum of Money, which was well known, and allowed by the Magistrats for the time; he did, and doth reckon himself Secure, that he shall injoy the said Office according to his Gift.</p>
            <p>Some of the present Magistrats having taken a Disgust at their Clerk, have not been pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to favour him with their Countenance, and have made many attempts to brangle his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Gift.</p>
            <p>In prosecution of that Design, the Magistrats did apply to the last Session of Parliament, in <hi>anno</hi> 1695, Representing a great many pretended Malversations, which were made very gross in Show and desiring that these Malversation might be Judged in Parliament.</p>
            <p>When the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etition and Answers were considered, it was moved and urged in Parliament, that the Decision of the pretended Malversations might be remitted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the Town Council; But the Estates of Parliament perceiving that the Magistrats had Stated themselves as Accusers by offering the Complaint, thought not fit to make them Judges of it, but remitted the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with the Answers to the Lords of Session to be Discust summarly as accords.</p>
            <p>These pretended Malversations were represented to be very Attrocious; because it was not expected the Parliament would have time to inquire: but after the Decision was remitted to the Lords of Session, there was no more mention of them; and the World may Judge by that Petition, and what hath since followed, that the Complainers did not relent, but were self convict that the Complaint would appear Groundless in the eyes of any indifferent Judge.</p>
            <p>This Attempt proving abor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gistrats reckoned themselves Judges of all other Malversations not stated before the Parliament; And dilgent Search and Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iscation was made for new pretences, and a Libel was framed with great Secrecy, and at last the Clerk was Cited to Answer in 24 Hours, and all was prepared to deprive him: But in that short Space, he made full and convincing Answers to any indifferent Judge, and did ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Advocation put a Period to these pretended Malversations also, for the Magistrats very well know that none of them would sustain, unless they themselves were the Judges, they were wearied of their Clerk, and impatient to be fettered by the Legal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As to the Material Justice of the Sentence, the Clerk is not in a present condition to make a full and exact State of what is charged upon him, nor doth so much as know the Tenor of the Sentence against him, because all he heard of his Crime were a few words exprest by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats, to his great surprize, and so he was removed, untill he was called to hear the Councils Interloquitor read; but the Magistrats have been very careful to take up the Minuts of that Journal, and the Sentence out of the Under-Clerks hands, that he may not so much as know what is charged or determined against him, or be in condition to vindicat himself in the eyes of the World: But whether Guilty or not Guilty, the Illegal manner of Deprivation requires that he should be repossess'd, &amp; the Cause Judged in the forms; yet that he may not ly under the imputation of guilt, in the mean time he will fairly state all that was charged upon him, as far as he can collect either from his Memory of what past at the time, or by information of what any of the Council pretend, to vindicate their procedure.</p>
            <p>The Charge is, That Tacks set by the Magistrats and Council, are only Signed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats, and the Clerk by his Office Signs for the rest of the Common Council, besides the Magistrats: And it is the duty of the Clerk to see Witnesses Adhibite, and Subscribing as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to the Subscription of the Magistrats and Tacks-men: Nevertheless he Malversed by n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting his Duty in the whole Tract of 10 or 11 Tacks, which are all utterly null and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual by his neg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect: In so far as, 1. He Signed one or more Tacks as Nottar for the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but got no Witnesses adhibite to them. 2. Other Tacks were not so much as Signed by him for the Community, nor were any Witnesses adhibite to the Magistrats, or Tacks-mens Subscriptions, and so the Tacks are null through his default, which is a continued Tract of Supine Negligence. 3. Even as to the form of Procedure, they alledge a Precedent in the case of Sir <hi>William Thomson,</hi> who was summarly deprived by the Magistrats, without Process, and their Sentence was sustained by a solemn Decision of the Lords.</p>
            <p>To this mighty Charge it is Answered in general, that the Clerk did not omit one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:171793:5"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:171793:6"/> of his Duty, but was grievously and unjustly oppressed in the whole matter, of setting of Tacks; nor is there an Accuser, nor any Damnage actually sustained, or which possibly could be sustained, holding the matter of Fact to be true, as is alledged.</p>
            <p>The Clerk freely acknowledges, It is suitable to his Office and Duty, to Sign for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and likewise to see Witnesses adhibite, and so long as he was allowed he did his duty exactly; but the Magistrats, and particularly the Thesaurer, were pleased to envy the just Casuality of a Complement in use to be payed by the Tacks-men at the Signing of Tacks, and so soon as the Tacks mentioned in the Charge were Signed by the Magistrats, the Thesaurer in presence, and by allowance of the Council, took up the Tacks from the Council-Board, on presence forsooth; That the Tacks being signed by the Magistrats, Blank as to the Sums and Tack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mens Names, it was not fit to trust the Clerk with them, and did not allow the Clerk to be present when the Tacks were Signed by the Tacks-men, but caused Sign the same privatly in his own Chamber, without any advertisement to the Clerk or his Servants to be present; the Thesaurer took no notice to adhibite Witnesses, so that some Tacks have no Witnesses insert, others none Subscribing; yea, after the Tacks were Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this irregular manner, the Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>saurer was not then careful to advertise the Clerk, or to put the Tacks in his hand, but of the Tacks 4 or 5 remain yet in the Thesaurers hands, and the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mainder which were Signed in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> were many Months after given in to the Under-Clerks Servant by the Thesaurer, and were never in the Clerks hands, or under his trust first nor last, but were brought by that Servant at the hour of Mr. <hi>M<seg rend="sup">c</seg>leod</hi>'s Deprivation, and delivered by him at the Council Table.</p>
            <p>This Servant who had the Papers, has not so much as an immediate dependance on Mr. <hi>M<seg rend="sup">c</seg>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leod,</hi> the Under-Clerk his Master is a Depute of the Councils nomination, and depends imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly upon them.</p>
            <p>These being the true Circumstances of the Matter of Fact, let the whole World judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Thesaurer did not unjustly incroach on the Clerks Office and Casuality, or if the Clerk was guilty of any neglect of his Duty.</p>
            <p>This treatment of the Clerk was so extraordinary and injurious, that possibly t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>presented by the Clerk, may not at first gain full credit, but to verify the same, the Clerk is well perswaded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Thesaurer will acknowledge, that the Tack were so taken up, and privatly Signed, which will be fortifyed, if need be is, by the Testimony of the Tacks-men and Cautioners. 2. The Thesaurer will acknowledge, that 4 or 5 of these Tacks remained in his hand, at the time when the Clerk was Challenged. 3. The whole Members of the Council will prove that the Tacks were taken up by the Thesaurer in Face, and by Allowance of Council. 4. The Under-Clerk, and his Servant who are the ordinary Witnesses to all the Tacks, being asked how they came not to Sign as Witnesses, did declare in pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence of Council, at the time when the Clerk was deprived, that they could not sign, because they did not see the Tacks-men subscribe.</p>
            <p>The M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>strats further Alledged, That whatever may be said, as to the Signing of the Witnesses, yet why did the Clerk neglect to Sign for the Commuity in all the Tacks, seing the Magistrats Signed, and why did he Sign for the Commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty in some, and Ommit in others.</p>
            <p>It is Answered very plainly, It was neither usual nor safe to Sign for the Community at the time, when the Magistrats Signed; because Sir <hi>William Thomson</hi>'s Crime was, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igned for the Community the Tack fell in the Tacks-mens hand without signing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Town was Bound, and the Tacks-men Loose, and therefore since that time, Clerks do not adhibit their Subscription for the Community, till the Tacks men have subscribed, because, untill the Clerk sign for the Community, the Tack is incompleat, and so tho' it should fall by, or come in the hands of the Tacks-men, the Town can never be prejudged, and the Thesaurer having got the Tack subscribed priva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly by the Tacks-men, it was his fault that the Clerk had no opportunity to sign for the community.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Tacks signed by the Clerk for the Community, as he remembers, there is but on in that Circumstance. And it is so far from being a furder Charge, that it fully evidenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the Clerks care to do his Duty, when ever he had access to do it, which after all was not for a considerable time after it was signed; For the Thesaurer having unjustly incroached, by taking up the Tacks, and the Council having allowed him in it, the Clerk might very well have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, to have concerned himself furder in the matter; yet so soon as any of these Tacks came to the Clerks hands, signed by the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hich is all that is properly his Duty, he could not cause Witnesses Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be, because he knew not who were Witnesses to the Tacks mens Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Town neither did, nor could possibly receive any material damnage, by all these pretended Ommission, because the Town Tacks are all set by Roup and the Form of Roup is, First, The Articles and Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ther was, nor could be any damnage, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eside Ommissions, though they could really be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, as in this case, there is not one circumstance of neglect in the Clerk, yet they are not relevant to infer Deprivation, especially in matters of small moment for there ought always to be a Proportion, and Measure betwixt the Crime and the Punishment.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is alledged, that the Council did proceed as summarly, and upon as slender Grounds in the case of Sir <hi>William Thomson,</hi> and their Sentence was sustained by the Lords of Session,</p>
            <p>It is answered 1. The Procedure against Sir <hi>William Thomson,</hi> was of no good consequence to the Town, and very little approven by the Nation: and after much Charge on both sides, the Matter was ended by Transaction, whereby Sir <hi>William</hi> got 4000 Merks out of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of yearly Annuity during his life, without trouble, or attendance: And because the <hi>superplus</hi> of the Dues of the Office were very inconsiderable, the succeeding Conjunct Clerks got 2000 Merks yearly, payed out of the Common-Good during Sir <hi>Williams</hi> life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time: And after all the Clerks that were named to succeed him, did Resign; and a new Gift was granted upon his Dimission; nor was that Decreet ever Extracted: and if the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action had not prevented, it would have probably furnished a Prece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent to the Clerks in this case. And therefore that Practique was ever since, rather considered as a Scat-Crow, than a Copy to be Transcribed.</p>
            <p>The cases differ vastly; For 1. In that case there was an unjustifiable Omission, which might have been of great damnage to the Town, instructed and ackn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wledged: Sir <hi>William</hi> desired no delay of Procedure but judicially submitted himself to the Town. 2. In that case it was specially remarked that his Office was gratuitous 3. There the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats had showen no evil Intention or Malice against their Clerk, whereas here they were sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Accusers before the Parliament, and upon that Ground two Advocations had past by the Lords of Session; the last of which, contained a general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rohibition, that they should not Judge of any Malversation of the Clerk; yet in manifest contempt, they have Judged and Deprived upon pretended Omissions, anterior to the said Advocations duely intimated.</p>
            <p>And lastly, because the Magistrats mention a Precedent, the Clerk condescends upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the case of <hi>William Bell</hi> Town-Clerk of <hi>Linlith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow,</hi> where the Magistrats having Formerly deprived their Clerk, upon a Letter impetrat from the late King <hi>James,</hi> and he being restored, they deprived him again, not in such a Preposterous and Arbitrary Method as this was; but being warned to attend the Court, at a certain Dyet Lybels were exhibit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; and he alledging that he had not received Doubles of the Lybels, and craving a delay, it was granted for one day; and in stead of Attending, he came to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to procure an Advocation; therefore the Magistrats the next day, did proceed to Deprivation in absence, and named a Successor.</p>
            <p>The Clerk applyed to the Privy Council, Representing the former Hardship he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that there was no competent time allowed to obtain Suspension or Advocation, before pronouncing and executing the Sentence, and upon that Ground after full Debate, he was Reponed by the Privy Council: and the Magistrats having made a second Application, the same was Rejected, and he re-possessed, by vertue whereof, he enjoys his Office to this day.</p>
            <p>This Practique is late, about a 12 Month ago was fully Debate, and considered by the Lieges, as a Security of their Places and Possessions, that the same might not be summarly inverted: And the Ground of the Decision quadrats, <hi>viz.</hi> the Malice of the Magistrats, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the present case; beside their known Malice, there was a legal Restraint upon them. The Magistrats of <hi>Linlithgow</hi> used the Formality of a Lybel, and were so bountiful as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Double, and a Day to Answer, and the Clerk did not attend them at that Day: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as here, there was no Accuser, no Lybel, no Process, no Delay, but all precipitantly done in an hour; and the Clerk tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
